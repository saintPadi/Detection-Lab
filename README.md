# CYBER RISK AND MATURITY ASSESMENT LAB

## Objective
This Lab project is a part of leveleffect's compliance fundamentals course, is aimed to simulate a real-life experience of a risk and maturity assesment, by using the IT Audit notes that summarizes the maturity of a fictional company, "GoodCorp" which we are auditing. The notes were used to rate the maturity according to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework(NIST SP 800-53) using the NIST CSF tool made by John Masserini.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of CyberSecurity Risk and compliance concepts.
- Proficiency in rating policy maturity and practice maturity.
- Ability to create policies with reference to cybersecurty Standards.


### Tools Used
- NIST CSF TOOL
- MICROSOFT EXCEL

  ### STANDARDS USED
  - NIST CSF (SP 800-53)
  - ISO 27001
  - COBIT 5
  - CIS CS C1-14

Ref 1: Maturity Levels.This image explains how the tool rates both the policy and practice.A score of 1- the policy does not exist or is not approved by manageent. 2- A policy has been created but it is not been reviewed for more than 2 years. 3- a policy has been instituted and approved by management,execptions are docuemented and occur less than 5% of the time. 4- a policy has been instituted and approved by management,execptions are docuemented and occur less than 3% of the time.As seen, this is in regard to the scoring for the policy and that of the practice rating is right next to it.
