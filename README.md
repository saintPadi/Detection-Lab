# CYBER RISK AND MATURITY ASSESMENT LAB

## Objective
This Lab project is a part of leveleffect's compliance fundamentals course, is aimed to simulate a real-life experience of a risk and maturity assesment, by using the IT Audit notes that summarizes the maturity of a fictional company, "GoodCorp" which we are auditing. The notes were used to rate the maturity according to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework(NIST SP 800-53) using the NIST CSF tool made by John Masserini.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of CyberSecurity Risk and compliance concepts.
- Proficiency in rating policy maturity and practice maturity.
- Ability to create policies with reference to cybersecurty Standards.


### Tools Used
- NIST CSF TOOL
- MICROSOFT EXCEL

  ### STANDARDS USED
  - NIST CSF (SP 800-53)
  - ISO 27001
  - COBIT 5
  - CIS CS C1-14

Ref 1: Maturity Levels.This image explains how the tool rates both the policy and practice.A score of 1- the policy does not exist or is not approved by manageent. 2- A policy has been created but it is not been reviewed for more than 2 years. 3- a policy has been instituted and approved by management,execptions are docuemented and occur less than 5% of the time. 4- a policy has been instituted and approved by management,execptions are docuemented and occur less than 3% of the time.As seen, this is in regard to the scoring for the policy and that of the practice rating is right next to it.

A brief introduction into the NIST CSF tool and how to use it to interpret the notes into maturity ratings.

The Audit notes of " GoodCorp" from an interview , the audit notes have been split into the sections but we are focusing just on the asset management section part of this lab.

As seen here, the target score for asset management has been changed from 3.00 to 4.00 and we can see the drastic change from the green zone to the red zone and the drastich change reflected on the graph.

NIST CSF Core figures for Asset management reset to zero (0) . We are going to do a maturity assesment of the asset management portion of the audit notes, using the maturity levels sheet as the reference.

The new NIST CSF Summary showing the finalized maturity assesment. we can see a final target score of 1.00 because from the notes, we deducted that there are no  policies in place to ensure security of assets, hence the lowest score is given here.
